            Hello @${{ github.event.pull_request.user.login }}, and thank you very much for your
            first pull request to the Zephyr project!
            
            While our Continuous Integration jobs run against your PR and check it's compliant and
            doesn't break anything,  and doesn't cause any issues, you might want to take this
            opportunity to review the project's [Contributor
            Expectations](https://docs.zephyrproject.org/latest/contribute/contributor_expectations.html)
            and make any updates to your pull request if necessary. 😊
